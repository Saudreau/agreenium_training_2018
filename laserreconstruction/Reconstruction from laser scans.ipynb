To launch an automatic reconstruction, you can use the menu `Reconstruction>Skeletization>Xu et al.`. It asks for the size of the internode of the skeleton. For this a ratio with the heigth of the point cloud is prompted. Using default value of 50 gives you the following results.\n",

However, it is very sensitive to noise. Another method is to use the pipe model (See `Reconstruction>Radius>Pipe Model`). It requires an estimate of the radius of a first root node and of the leaves.
